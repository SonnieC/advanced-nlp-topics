The aromas are seamlessly integrated, to incorporate ripe red cherry, chocolate fudge, licorice and a finely chiseled mineral note. The wine is layered with beautifully aromatic nuances and rock solid tannins in the mouth. A small portion of Merlot (15%) is blended into this Aglianico-based wine to achieve plush concentration and inviting aromas of forest berry, cookie dough, peppermint, Porcini mushroom, spice and loads of licorice. It's a very solid and tannic wine that would pair well with hearty meat or game dishes: Oak-aged for 12 months. Year after year, Feudi's Taurasi delivers amazing intensity and volcanic soil aromas that are so distinctive they immediately give its Campania roots away. This boasts bold cherry, with deep tones of sweet-smelling blue flower, licorice, pinecone, tobacco, campfire and charcoal. The wine is plush and velvety on the palate and those fantastic mineral notes emerge on the finale. Despite its seven years of age (two of which were spent in oak), this is a seemingly youthful wine with bright and lively fruity tones of berries, cherry soda or candy, red apple backed by a supporting cast of vanilla, cedar and roasted nuts. It offers chewy, firm tannins and good length on the finish. The flagship of the Feudi fleet, this powerful wine is 70% Aglianico and 30% Merlot, Shiraz and Piedirosso. The wine is complex from the start with cherry, plum, chocolate, black pepper and toasted oak. With standing, even more nuances appear. On the palate, it is rich and robustâ\\x80\\x94the tannins just need a little softening. The persistent finish replicates the initial aromatics. A true tour de force. Cellar Selection. This is a very attractive wine with loads of personality and a long list of aromatic characteristics: Porcino mushroom, cedar, spice, licorice and scented candle. It's a bit shy on the fruit though: Very modern and intense in the mouth with waxy flavors on the close. Dark at first, with raspberry emerging. Throughout it's snappy, with red fruit dominant. Finishes clean, tight and crisp, with solid tannins that don't go overboard. An everyday, drink-me style of Aglianico. A very characteristic wine of southern Italy, the nose delivers cherry, berry, tobacco, root beer, balsamic, red earth and linseed oil aromas. In fact, there's a lingering perfume reminiscent of paints in an artist's studio. The wine is elegant in the mouth with crisp acidity and a long finish. This Aglianico imparts bright berry fruit, candied cherry, blueberry, licorice, white mushroom and a hearty dose of licorice. Dark, mysterious and dense, it has a solid structure and good length and would pair well with stewed rabbit or roasted lamb. Deep, ripe and syrupy on the nose, with leather, brambly red fruit and licorice. Seemingly on the ripe side, but still juicy and fresh. The plum and berry fruit is mature, while proper aging has added a smoky edge along with carob, earth and coffee nuances. A spicy, sun-baked Aglianico that deals cherry, bourbon and piles of hard spice. The flavors of dried cherries and cinnamon are subtle and enticing, while the tight, hard finish offers raisin and other baked fruits. Not complex but good in a finite way. A young, chunky heavyweight is the only way to describe this black wine, which smells of fruitcake and herbs, and tastes of baked plums and chocolate. Rich and overflowing, and building to a tannic crescendo. One can see the mass appeal here. Seems a bit late to just be making the market, but Taurasi has staying power and this wine is far from over the hill. Spice, cinnamon and root beer mix with black fruit on the loud nose, while the palate spins mostly cherry and raspberry. Lively but raw, with outsized tannins that pound away without mercy. Bulky fruit, leather and some overt wood manifesting itself as dry cheese comprise the bouquet. Plum, red currant and cherry tomato make for a tight, snappy palate. Lots of zip, although tannic and tight.\""
